## My process

Starting with mobile first I worked on creating a cohesive layout for the HMTL which would be considering the connection for formating the styling and the shifting of objects. This way, I need not go back to revise any HTML elements, just call upon them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was nice to be able to use and implement grid. I have a good understanding of the layout but the more practice I get implementing, the better I understand the intricacies. 


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
